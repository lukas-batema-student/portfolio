          experience. That's right, I have been programming since I was 11!
          I understand that knowledge is not defined by length of experience,
          but by the effort of experience you put into it. In other words, it
          is the time you put into the time, to get the true experience level.
          I also am a music artist, who goes under the pseudonym
